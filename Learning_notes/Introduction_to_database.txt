Introduction to SQL

Relational database-collection of tables
Row-Record
Column-Field

Multiple rows and columns
Eg.select  field_name1,field_name2 from table_name;

Limit rows and columns
Eg.select * from table_name limit num;

Use DISTINCT key words to not to duplicate.(unique)
Eg.select distinct Field_name from table_name;

Use COUNT(*) to Check the Total numbers of rows
Eg.select count(*) from table_name;

COUNT(*) also can be used like this 
eg.count(field_name)all of the number of non-missing values in a particular columns.
eg.count(distinct field_name)unique 

Comparison Operators 
= equal
<> not equal != 
< less than
> greater than
<= less than equal
>= greater than equal

Filtering the quaries using WHERE
Eg.select * from table_name where condition;

WHERE condition AND condition
-select * from table_name 
where condition
and condition;
**You can add as many AND conditions as you need!**
**where(condition AND condition)**

WHERE condition OR condition
-select  * from table_name 
where condition
or condition;
**You can add as many OR conditions as you need!**
**where(condition OR condition)**

Combination of AND and OR condition
-select * from table_name
where (condition OR conditon) // individual clauses in parentheses
and (condition OR condition);

BETWEEN
-select * from table_name
where field_name
BETWEEN condition;

Using WHERE IN condition to midify the WHERE OR condition
-select * from table_name
where field_name in (text values,numeric values)

NULL and IS NULL
-null represents a missing or unknown value.
-is null is useful to combined with WHERE
-IS NOT NULL to filter out missing values which are not null

LIKE and NOT LIKE
-to search for a pattern in a column
select field_name
from table_name
where field_name LIKE 'B%' or '_B'
2 wildcards to use with LIKE: % and _
% is zero,one or many characters in text. For Eg.to search a many like 'Data','DataC','DataCamp', so on
Use Where name LIKE 'Data%';
_ is a single character. For Eg. to search a many quareis like 'DataCamp','DataComp',so on
Use Where name LIKE ' DataC_mp';


Aggregate Function
-to perform some calculation on the data in a database.
AVG( )
MAX( )
SUM( )
MIN( )


Combination aggregate functions with WHERE
select sum(field_name)
from table_name
where condition;

A note on arithmetic
+,-,*,/

It's AS simple AS aliasing
-means you assign a temporary name to something.
select max(budget) as max_budget,
max(duration) as max_duration
from films;

ORDER BY
Ascending Order
-select field_name
from table_name
order by field_name;

Descending Order
-select field_name
from table_name
order by field_name desc;
